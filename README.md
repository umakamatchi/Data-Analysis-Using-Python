# Analyzing Mobile App Data

# Introduction

Build Android and iOS mobile apps that available on Google Play and in the App Store.

Build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that the number of users of our apps determines our revenue for any given app â€” the more users who see and engage with the ads, the better. Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users.

# Dataset

A dataset containing data about approximately 10,000 Android apps from Google Play; the data was collected in August 2018. You can download the data set directly from this link.

A dataset containing data about approximately 7,000 iOS apps from the App Store; the data was collected in July 2017. You can download the data set directly from this link.

# Conclusion

In this project, we analyzed data about the App Store and Google Play mobile apps with the goal of recommending an app profile that can be profitable for both markets.

We concluded that taking a popular book (perhaps a more recent book) and turning it into an app could be profitable for both the Google Play and the App Store markets. The markets are already full of libraries, so we need to add some special features besides the raw version of the book. This might include daily quotes from the book, an audio version of the book, quizzes on the book, a forum where people can discuss the book, etc.
